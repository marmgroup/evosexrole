# Evolution of sex roles: individual-based simulation

Xiaoyan Long and Franz J. Weissing

Here we show how to predict evolution of sex roles using individual-based simulations presented in Methods. 

All the code needed for the simulation is contained in the file `evolution of sex roles.cpp`. In our baseline scenario, we used `parameter_1.text`. We can explore the effect of anisogamy, synergy effect on evolution of parental roles by changing the parameter values easily. In the scenario where sexual selection has been considered, we used `parameter_2.text`.
