# Evolution of sex roles: individual-based simulation

Xiaoyan Long and Franz J. Weissing

Here we show how to predict evolution of sex roles using individual-based simulation presented in our Methods. 

All the code needed for the simulation is contained in the file `evolution of sex roles.cpp`. In our baseline scenario where females and males mate at random, we used `parameter_1.text`. We can explore the effect of anisogamy, synergy effect on the evolution of parental roles by changing the parameter values easily. In the scenario where sexual selection has been considered, we used `parameter_2.text`. In this case, female preferences and male ornaments are allowed to evolve with occurring of small mutations.
