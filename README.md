This repository contains code for individual-based simulation and mathematical analysis.

The `evorole` folder contains all files that are needed for individual-based simulation. Please read the `README` file carefully before you start to run all simulations. All the simulations run in Visual Studio 2019.

The `Mathematical analysis` folder contains one pdf file indicating the details of mathematical analysis and one Mathematica notebook showing how we get the evolutionary trajectories and pairwise invasibility plots by applying evolutionary invasion analysis as shown in `Evolution of sex roles_Mathematical analysis.pdf`.
