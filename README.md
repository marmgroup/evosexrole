This repository contains code for individual-based simulation and mathematical analysis.

The `Individual-based simulation` folder contains one cpp file and two representative parameter settings, the `README` file explains the differences between `parameter_1.txt` and `parameter_2.txt`. All the simulations run in Visual Studio 2017.

The `Mathematical analysis` folder contains one pdf file indicating the details of mathematical analysis and one Mathematica notebook showing how we get the evolutionary trajectories and pairwise invasibility plots by applying evolutionary invasion analysis as shown in `Evolution of sex roles_Mathematical analysis.pdf`.
